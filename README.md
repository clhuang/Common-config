NVIM configuration for programming in Python and Typescript. Uses Coc-vim for language completion features.
Ensure you have the latest version of Neovim: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases
Symlink vim_runtime to ~/.vim_runtime, vimrc to ~/.config/nvim/init.vim, coc-settings.json to ~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json.

Other steps include installing jedi (clone the repo to your home folder)...

As for figuring out keybindings... good luck!
