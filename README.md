VIM configuration for programming in python.
Symlink vim_runtime to ~/.vim_runtime, vimrc to ~/.vimrc.

Other steps include installing jedi (vim_runtime/sources_forked/jedi_vim/jedi), ctags (from the internet), and your powerline font of choice from github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts (the current one specified is Ubuntu Mono Powerline).

As for figuring out keybindings... good luck! Most of the plugins follow default keybindings, but caveat emptor.
